# üõ°Ô∏è Age of War - Platoon Battle Optimizer

This Ruby script takes two sets of platoons ‚Äî your own army and the enemy's ‚Äî and tries all possible permutations to find the best order of attack. The goal is to **win at least 3 out of 5 matches** by using the advantage mapping between different platoon types.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Problem Statement

Each side has 5 platoons defined in the format:  
`Type#Count;Type#Count;...`

Each platoon has a specific advantage over others. If a platoon has an advantage over the opponent, its effective power doubles. Based on that, we determine the result as `win`, `draw`, or `lose`.

---

## üß† Logic Summary

- We define each **Platoon** as a Ruby object with a type and count.
- We use a static **ADVANTAGE_MAP** to check type superiority.
- The script tries **every possible arrangement** of your platoons using Ruby‚Äôs `.permutation`.
- The first arrangement that results in 3 or more wins is returned.
- If no such permutation is found, we print: `"There is no chance of winning"`

## ‚úÖ Example

```ruby
own = "Spearmen#10;Militia#30;FootArcher#20;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120"
enemy = "Militia#10;Spearmen#10;FootArcher#1000;LightCavalry#120;CavalryArcher#100"
puts find_winning_order(own, enemy)



## Test Scenarios

// You can test the program by modifying or running the following examples: //

# 1. Clear winning matchups
find_winning_order("Militia#50;Spearmen#40;FootArcher#90;LightCavalry#20;HeavyCavalry#70", 
                   "Spearmen#30;LightCavalry#20;CavalryArcher#40;FootArcher#60;Militia#10")

# 2. No chance of winning
find_winning_order("Militia#10;Militia#10;Militia#10;Militia#10;Militia#10", 
                   "HeavyCavalry#100;HeavyCavalry#100;HeavyCavalry#100;HeavyCavalry#100;HeavyCavalry#100")
